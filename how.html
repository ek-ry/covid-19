    <p>The virus has been spreading since late December. When it first broke out, it was mostly contained to China. Over the past three months, it has touched more than 100 countries and transformed Europe into its newest epicentre.</p><br />
    <p>Kwong said that while it may seem like it caught on quickly, it’s likely its spread in North America that is drawing increased attention.</p><br />
    <p>“It’s been in China for a number of months already. It’s not the most contagious spread of infection — there’s a lot of other diseases that are much more contagious — but because there’s a lack of immunity in the population, we’re seeing a widespread
        transmission,” he said.</p><br />
    <p>While there is a test to identify the virus, and clinical studies underway for a cure, there is currently no vaccine to prevent an infection or a treatment for those infected.</p><br />
    <p>Kwong believes general global modernization played a role in the spread.</p><br />
    <p>“There’s been an increase in global travel since the last virus that sort of propagates things further and helps it proliferate, just by the fact more people are moving around,” he said.</p><br />
    <p>A study released Monday in conjunction with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) suggests that the contagiousness of the virus is likely a result of a large number of undetected infections early on in the outbreak.</p><br
    />
    <p>Many of the undocumented infections were already circulating long before China and others moved to heighten control and travel measures in late January, the study found.</p><br />
    <p>“These undetected cases seem to have been less contagious than the detected ones,” said Ashleigh Tuite, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, who reviewed the study. “But because there were so many, their
        overall contribution to the spread was substantial.”</p><br />
