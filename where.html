    <p>It’s believed the new virus started in a “wet market” in Wuhan, China, where, like many other markets in Asia, farmed and exotic animals are tied up or stacked in cages. Many are killed on-site to ensure freshness.</p><br />
    <p>The markets are considered breeding grounds for new and dangerous infections, health experts say, because the close contact between humans and live exotic animals makes it easier for viruses to jump between species. SARS originated from the same type
        of market in 2002.</p><br />
    <p>“This virus is closely related to known bat viruses. That’s why it’s believed to have originated from a bat,” said Dr. Jeff Kwong, an epidemiologist and scientist with ICES and Public Health Ontario.</p><br />
    <p>“It then somehow got into another animal and then acquired the ability to infect humans. We call these sorts of infections zoonotic infections — they can infect multiple mammals and cross between species.”</p><br />
    <p>Scientists have not yet determined exactly how the new coronavirus first infected humans, but Stanley Perlman, a coronavirus expert at the University of Iowa, said it likely unfolded in a chain of events.</p><br />
    <p>Since bats were not sold at the Wuhan market where the virus is believed to have originated, it’s likely another animal sold there was infected.</p><br />
    <p>“In this instance, we think that bats infected an intermediary host that served as the immediate source for the human infection,” he said.</p><br />
    <p>“However, we do not know if this is the case or, rather, if an unidentified bat coronavirus nearly identical to the human strain jumped directly to humans.”</p><br />
    <p>However, he acknowledged there’s still a lot unknown about the origin.</p><br />
    <p>“There are several bat coronaviruses that are theoretically able to infect humans and were predicted by some scientists as able to cross species to infect humans,” he said.</p><br />
    <p>“Unfortunately, this could happen again with another one of these bat coronaviruses.”</p><br />
